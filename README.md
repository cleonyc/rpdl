# RPDL

This project was mainly developed as a way to learn gtk-rs, and will likely have few future updates, as it's entirely a personal project for me. It serves as an easy way to download packs from mediafire and pvprp.

## Usage 

On linux, download the executable and `chmod +x` it, then run it. In the future I'll make an appimage, flatpak, and aur entry for it. 

Doesn't currently support windows or macos, because gtk is really frustrating. 

Once running, enter the mediafire or pvprp url into the text box and press download, then it should appear in your resourcepacks folder. 

## Building

Doesn't do anything fancy, so `cargo build` should work fine.
